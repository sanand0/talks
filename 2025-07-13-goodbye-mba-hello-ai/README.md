## [LLMs fail in surprising ways](https://sanand0.github.io/llmmath/)

There's a _jagged edge_ of capability. See how they multiply integers:

| Model            |   % | 2d  | 3d  | 4d  | 5d  | 6d  | 7d  | 9d  |
| ---------------- | --: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI O3        | 86% | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ❌  |
| Deepseek v3      | 71% | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ❌  | ❌  |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | 57% | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ❌  | ❌  | ❌  |

## Use LLMs to make _you_ smarter

- **Sparring partner**. Create Custom GPTs per course with lectures + case PDFs. Have it to quiz you Socratically every week.
- **Sprint**. Create LLM drafts. Have LLMs critique, surface assumptions. Rewrite yourself.
- Update a personal **prompt-library** every time an LLM _wows_ you
- **Rehearse**. Have ChatGPT quiz you like a CFO, COO, regulator, ... for your job interview / case presentation... and give **feedback**.
- **Don't** memorize or do the grunt work. Delegate that to LLMs.
