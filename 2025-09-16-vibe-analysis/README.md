## Vibe Coding: code like code doesn't exist

> ... where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.

> I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment

> Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.

## Vibe Analysis: analyze, but ignore the code

Here's the vibe analysis mindset:

- You're **pragmatic**. You care about insights, not how they're coded.
- You're **sceptical**. You cross-question and find errors.
- You're **playful**. You try weird "what ifs" just to see what breaks.

Let's analyze some datasets with this mindset.

## Now we'll use LLMs for _everything_

1. Explore data
2. Clean data
3. Model data
4. Explain data
5. Deploy data
6. Anonymize data
