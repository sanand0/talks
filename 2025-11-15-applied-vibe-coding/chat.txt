2025-11-15 18:52:10 From Arjun Thilak To Anand S (direct message): Hi sir, I’ve actually been using VibeCoding for a few months now even during my internship and it has helped me a lot. I’m currently in my 4th year and from a data science background, focusing on DS/ML roles. I wanted to get your perspective on the future direction for students like us. With tools like Claude Code becoming extremely powerful, do you think mastering these AI-assisted workflows is going to be more than enough and possibly change how we learn and work? Or should we still focus heavily on traditional paths like deep DSA/LeetCode-style problem solving? And specifically for data science/ML roles, should we prioritize learning end-to-end frameworks and libraries (like PyTorch, TensorFlow, MLOps pipelines), or balance both?

2025-11-15 19:13:09 From Charchit Sharma To Everyone: Replying to "In how many ways does vibe coding improves our ski...": I think vibe coding helps only if you’re actually learning while doing it. It can boost your consistency, make coding feel less draining, and help you pick up small tricks faster. It builds confidence because you’re touching code daily instead of overthinking. But it won’t magically improve logic or fundamentals unless you put real effort into understanding what you write. It’s good for momentum, not a substitute for deep study. (HARSHWARDHAN SINGH, 25F2006899 Shreyak Mitra, TANIYA HALDER, Arun:👍)

2025-11-15 19:18:22 From Tarang Jhaveri To Everyone: So may be vibe coding can be used for small tasks but not full blown apps
2025-11-15 19:18:49 From HARSHWARDHAN SINGH To Everyone: Replying to "Why do not we try the possible things that can be ...": building apps/games using vibe-coding is helpful for a developer as they can improve it, instead of creating something from scratch (Charchit Sharma, 25F2006906 SACRAVARTHY G:👍)
