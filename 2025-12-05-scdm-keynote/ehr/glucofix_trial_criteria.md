4. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**  
   - **BMI between 23.0 and 40.0 kg/m² (inclusive)** calculated as:

   - Height and weight must be measured at screening using calibrated equipment.

5. **Background Antihyperglycemic Therapy**  
   - On **stable dose of metformin ≥ 1000 mg/day** (or maximum tolerated dose ≥ 500 mg/day) for **≥ 3 months** before screening, **with or without** one additional oral agent (e.g., sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitor).  
   - No dose changes of background oral antihyperglycemic therapy in the **8 weeks** prior to screening.

6. **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)**

7. **Renal Function (eGFR)**  
   - **Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²**, calculated from **serum creatinine** measured within **90 days** before screening, using a validated formula (e.g., CKD-EPI or MDRD).  
   - Example (CKD-EPI creatinine-based) for adults:  
     - \( eGFR = 141 \times \min(\text{Scr}/\kappa, 1)^\alpha \times \max(\text{Scr}/\kappa, 1)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \times 1.018 \;[\text{if female}] \)  
       - Scr: serum creatinine (mg/dL)  
       - κ: 0.7 (female), 0.9 (male)  
       - α: −0.329 (female), −0.411 (male)

8. **Blood Pressure Control**  
   - **Systolic BP ≤ 160 mmHg** and **diastolic BP ≤ 95 mmHg** at screening (mean of **two readings** taken at least 2 minutes apart, seated, after 5 minutes’ rest), with or without antihypertensive medication.

9. **Contraception and Pregnancy Status (for women of childbearing potential)**  
   - Negative **serum or urine pregnancy test** at screening and randomization.  
   - Agreement to use at least **one highly effective contraceptive method** (e.g., hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, abstinence consistent with lifestyle) for the duration of the study and for **at least 4 weeks** after the last dose.

10. **Ability to Comply and Provide Consent**  
    - Able and willing to comply with study procedures, visit schedules, and study medication administration.  
    - **Signed informed consent** document in English or a local language (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu) understood by the participant, obtained prior to any study-specific procedures.

2. **Recent Diabetic Ketoacidosis or Hyperosmolar State**  
   - History of **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** or **hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)** within **6 months** prior to screening, confirmed by hospital discharge summary or EHR documentation.

3. **Significant Insulin Therapy**  
   - Use of **basal or prandial insulin** for **> 14 consecutive days** in the **3 months** prior to screening (except for short-term use during acute illness, surgery, or hospitalization).
