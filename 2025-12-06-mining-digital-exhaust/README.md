Here are the transcript for my workshop on Mining Digital Exhaust using LLMs.
Create a single-page HTML narrative story (like in The New York Times) written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell: Opens with a vivid, unexpected anecdote about an obscure person or event, then zooms out to reveal a counterintuitive thesis supported by social science research; conversational yet authoritative tone with frequent rhetorical questions; builds arguments through accumulating surprising case studies that all click together in a satisfying "aha" moment.

Ensure that you include prominent placeholders for the following:

- link to the transcript (use a dummy link for now)
- a sketchnote (use a dummy image link for now)
- the embedded YouTube video (use a dummy video for now)
- some of the data stories and other artifacts generated from this workshop
