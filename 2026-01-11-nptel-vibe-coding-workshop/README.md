Draw this as a visually rich, intricately detailed, colorful, and funny, sketchnote.

Here are the transcript for my workshop on Mining Digital Exhaust using LLMs.

Create a single-page HTML narrative story (like in The New York Times) written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell: Opens with a vivid, unexpected anecdote about an obscure person or event, then zooms out to reveal a counterintuitive thesis supported by social science research; conversational yet authoritative tone with frequent rhetorical questions; builds arguments through accumulating surprising case studies that all click together in a satisfying "aha" moment.

Ensure that you include these prominently:
