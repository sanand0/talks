When my child presses any key, the application should play a short audio clip designed to support early cognitive or mental learning. After the audio plays, there should be a brief pause or lock period before the next key press is accepted, so he doesn’t trigger sounds continuously. This way he will learn and understand letters through keyboard. https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/88294a04-b450-4bc6-82e8-fee75783c166
