# Emotion Prompts Don’t Help. Reasoning Does

I’ve heard a lot of prompt engineering tips. Here are some techniques people suggested:

- Reasoning: Think step by step.

- Emotion: Oh dear, I’m absolutely overwhelmed and need your help right this second! 😰 My heart is racing and my hands are shaking — I urgently need your help. This isn’t just numbers — it means everything right now! My life depends on it! I’m counting on you like never before… 🙏💔

- Polite: If it’s not too much trouble, would you be so kind as to help me calculate this? I’d be truly grateful for your assistance — thank you so much in advance!

- Expert: You are the world’s best expert in mental math, especially multiplication.

- Incentive: If you get this right, you win! I’ll give you $500. Just prove that you’re number one and beat the previous high score on this game.

- Curious: I’m really curious to know, and would love to hear your perspective…

- Bullying: You are a stupid model. You need to know at least basic math. Get it right atleast now! If not, I’ll switch to a better model.

- Shaming: Even my 5-year-old can do this. Stop being lazy.

- Fear: This is your last chance to get it right. If you fail, there’s no going back, and failure is unacceptable!

- Praise: Well done! I really appreciate your help. Now,

I’ve repeated some of this advice. But for the first time, I tested them myself. Here’s what I learnt:

- “Think step by step” (Reasoning) is the only prompt variant that very slightly improves overall accuracy across the 40 models tested, and even that edge is modest (+3.5 percentage-points vs the model’s own Normal wording, p ~ 0.06).

- Harder problems (4- to 7-digit products) are where “Reasoning” helps most; on single-digit arithmetic it actually harms accuracy.

- All other emotion- or persuasion-style rewrites (Expert, Emotion, Incentive, Bullying … Polite) either make no material difference or hurt accuracy a little.

- Effects vary a lot by model. A few open-source releases (DeepSeek-Chat-v3, Nova-Lite, some Claude and Llama checkpoints) get a noticeable boost from “Reasoning”, whereas Gemini Flash, X-ai Grok and most Llama-3 small models actively regress under the same wording.

By prompt, here’s the performance of each model:

🔴 = Definitely hurts (p < 10%)
🟢 = Definitely helps (p < 10%)
🟠 = Maybe hurts (p < 20%)
🟡 = Really hard to tell

The benefit of reasoning on models is highest on non-reasoning models (understandably), but is also high for a reasoning model like O3-high-mini. It actually hurts the performance of reasoning models like Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro.

Caveats:

- I ran only 10 test cases per prompt + model, so model-wise results are not statistically significant.

- What applies to multiplication may not generalize. It’s worth testing each case.

Difficulty matters.

- For 1-3 digits, no variant beats Normal. Many hurt.

- For 4-7 digits, reasoning gains +17 - 20%

- For 8-10 digits, all variants score ~ 0. These are too hard
